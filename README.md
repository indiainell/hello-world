# hello-world
A repository for learning and applying new things
I am a 34 year old service industry professional who is looking to have a career change. I enjoy listening and playing music, reading books, and hanging out with my dog, Deacon, and my cat, Lucifer. I lived in Los Angeles for quite some time, where I worked at a record label, Delicious Vinyl. I enjoyed my experience, but I love living in Louisville.
